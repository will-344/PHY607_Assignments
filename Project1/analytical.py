""" Module that provides the analytic solution to the following problems, with
necessary constants taken from function inputs:

ode1 (ODE): Steady 1D cylindrical heat conduction with no energy generation,
    assuming constant thermal conductivity, with specified temperature boundary
    conditions.
     
int1 (definite integral): Elliptical lift distribution for a finite wing,
    assuming incompressible, inviscid, and steady flow, using lifting-line
    theory in a uniform freestream with constant density.
