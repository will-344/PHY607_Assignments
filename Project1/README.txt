PHY 607 Project 1
Written by Will Martin

This purpose of this project is to compare numerical methods for solving 
ordinary differential equations and definite integrals with their exact 
solutions to determine the accuracy of the methods.

This project requires three Python libraries: Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy

Three Python code files are required produce results for this project, all of 
which must be located in the same directory:

	main.py - This is the main file to be run and is where conditions are 
			  specified and results out output
	analytical.py - This file is a module that is passed to main.py and is 
					where the exact solutions are solved
	numerical.py - This file is a module that is passed to main.py and is 
				   where the numerical solutions are solved
				   
To successfully run main.py, conditions must be specified at the top of the
file in the clearly marked section.
